<h2>Assessment 1: My profile</h2>


<h3> Personal Information </h3>

<ul>
<li>Name: Chloe Buzza</li>

<li>Student Number: 3644620</li>

<li>Email: s3644620@student.rmit.edu.au</li>

<li>Background: I was born in the small town of Narrogin in Western Australia, two hours South East of Perth. I am from a family of five, with two older brothers. I was sent to a catholic primary school in order to gain some understanding and education behind religion as my parents are not religious and we would not learn this at home. I am a Caucasian 26-year-old and we spoke only English at home, I am not fluent in another language. After completing my WACE at Penrhos College in 2011 I began an undergraduate degree in Psychology at Curtin University in 2012. In 2016 I gained employment at an insurance and financial planning business and completed my ASIC RG146 Tier 1 Insurance Broking Compliance certificate. In 2016 I also began my Bachelor in Business majoring in Financial Planning through RMIT university to become a financial planner for the company I work for. I also have my Certificate III and IV in Fitness and Personal Training.</li>
<li>Fun Fact: In June 2019 I bought my first home, it is a 1930 red brick cottage with high ceilings, beautiful cornice detail and lovely old jarrah floorboards. For the past year I have been doing it up, painting the walls and doing a lot of work in the garden and landscaping. My next big project is to put in a white picket fence around the front and I will eventually need to reroof as the tin roof is the original from 1930.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interest in IT:</h3>
<p>
I was born in 1994 which meant by the time I was three years of age we had a computer at home and by the time I was 14 I had my first mobile phone. I attended computer classes and used computers my entire schooling life. This has meant that I have been forced into an interest in IT in order to complete my day to day life and job. I believe to keep up with the world, both in career and socially, you need to keep up with IT innovation and changes. My brother studied computer programming and mechatronic engineering at university, he now works as a computer programmer for a mechatronic engineering company. He both keeps me interested and up to date with IT and continually teaches and shows me new aspects of IT.
<p>
I chose RMIT for its ability for classes to be accessed online through Open University, so ironically for its IT capabilities. RMIT offered a FASEA approved degree course to become a financial planner, this course is also being a blanket bachelor in business, I liked that this was more broadening if I ever wanted to change my career within the business and finance sector. The course being available through Open Universities also meant I was able to complete one unit at a time and still complete four units a year while working full time.
<p>
During this course I expect to learn how to use IT programs I have never heard of before such as GitHub and use tools such as Unity, Construct2 and MIT App Inventor. I also expect to learn some programming language.

<h3>Ideal Job:</h3>
<h4>Job advertisement:</h4>

<p>
Above is a financial planning job in Perth that has been advertised on seek. This appeals to me because it is a city that I can see myself living in for a long period of time and is close to family, friends and the lifestyle I like to live. Being a senior financial planner is also my ideal job and what I have been working towards for the past four years. 
<p>
The job will include providing personal financial advice to clients on superannuation, investments, long and short-term financial goals and personal insurances. I will need to service current clients and work on building the book of business by attracting new clients. I will need to keep up with and learn their compliance procedures, computer systems and client management systems. I will be a senior financial adviser which will mean I will have client service assistants and paraplanners working with me that I will need to assist and manage. 
<p>
I am required to complete my current degree, a bachelor of business majoring in financial planning and I am required to have at least one more year of experience working as a financial adviser. I have already completed my FASEA exam and am up to date with my FASEA training which is a requirement. I am currently competent in using Xplan which is client management and quoting software, this is also required for the position. It is also required that the successful applicant be a confident and social individual who works well in a team and with managers, has good organisational skills and is trustworthy, ethical and hard working. I believe that I have gained all of these skills in the position I have held in my current job as a financial planner assistant and financial planner.
<p>
I will need to complete another year working as a financial planner in the job I am currently in, this should involve taking on more responsibility, training and leadership responsibilities to prepare myself for the senior position. There are many professional development opportunities that come up within my work place which I will need to take up to gain the sufficient training. It would also be beneficial for me to enhance my skills in comprehensive computer presentations to deliver products and services to clients and improve my knowledge in and use of financial planning software and its full functionality. Improving my skills in these areas would help me to provide a higher level of service to clients, run comprehensive reports and be a more efficient employee.

<h4>The Big 5 Personality Test:</h4>
Your Personality Trait Scores
This Big Five assessment measures your scores on five major dimensions of personality: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (sometimes abbreviated OCEAN). Check out your scores on each of the five dimensions in the graph below, then read on to discover what each score means.
<p>
 
Openness
<p>
Openness describes a person’s tendency to think in abstract, complex ways. High scorers tend to be creative, adventurous, and intellectual. They enjoy playing with ideas and discovering novel experiences. Low scorers tend to be practical, conventional, and focused on the concrete. They tend to avoid the unknown and follow traditional ways.
<p>
Openness is strongly related to a person’s interest in art and culture. People who are high in openness tend to enjoy the arts and seek out unusual, complex forms of self-expression. People who are low in openness are often suspicious of the arts and prefer to focus on more practical pursuits.
<p>
Conscientiousness
<p>
Conscientiousness describes a person’s ability to exercise self-discipline and control in order to pursue their goals. High scorers are organized and determined, and are able to forego immediate gratification for the sake of long-term achievement. Low scorers are impulsive and easily sidetracked.
<p>
The concept of Conscientiousness focuses on a dilemma we all face: shall I do what feels good now, or instead do what is less fun but will pay off in the future? Some people are more likely to choose fun in the moment, and thus are low in Conscientiousness. Others are more likely to work doggedly toward their goals, and thus are high in this trait.
<p>
Extraversion
<p>
Extraversion describes a person’s inclination to seek stimulation from the outside world, especially in the form of attention from other people. Extraverts engage actively with others to earn friendship, admiration, power, status, excitement, and romance. Introverts, on the other hand, conserve their energy, and do not work as hard to earn these social rewards.
<p>
Extraversion seems to be related to the emotional payoff that a person gets from achieving a goal. While everyone experiences victories in life, it seems that extroverts are especially thrilled by these victories, especially when they earn the attention of others. Getting a promotion, finding a new romance, or winning an award are all likely to bring an extrovert great joy. In contrast, introverts do not experience as much of a “high” from social achievements. They tend to be more content with simple, quiet lives, and rarely seek attention from others.
<p>
Agreeableness
<p>
Agreeableness describes a person’s tendency to put others’ needs ahead of their own, and to cooperate rather than compete with others. People who are high in Agreeableness experience a great deal of empathy and tend to get pleasure out of serving and taking care of others. They are usually trusting and forgiving.
<p>
People who are low in Agreeableness tend to experience less empathy and put their own concerns ahead of others. Low scorers are often described as hostile, competitive, and antagonistic. They tend to have more conflictual relationships and often fall out with people.
<p>
Neuroticism
<p>
Neuroticism describes a person’s tendency to experience negative emotions, including fear, sadness, anxiety, guilt, and shame. While everyone experiences these emotions from time to time, some people are more prone to them than others.
This trait can be thought of as an alarm system. People experience negative emotions as a sign that something is wrong in the world. You may be in danger, so you feel fear. Or you may have done something morally wrong, so you feel guilty. However, not everyone has the same reaction to a given situation. High Neuroticism scorers are more likely to react to a situation with fear, anger, sadness, and the like. Low Neuroticism scorers are more likely to brush off their misfortune and move on.
<p>

<h4>How My Scores Relate to Me</h4>
<p>
According to the Myers-Briggs test I am the guardian which means I am likely to be organised, athletic, loyal and hard working. Unrelated to this unit or education, I am very athletic as the test suggests, having played field hockey since I was 5 years old, this however has made me a good team player and able to work with and adapt to many different personality types. I am very organised in both my home and work life which helps with a good work life balance and managing my work in busy times. I am loyal and hardworking, an attribute that was cemented while playing in elite hockey teams and enhanced my ability. Being loyal and hard working also helps in my work, it means I can provide an efficient and appreciated service to my clients. The Myers-Briggs test also indicates that I like being a leader and in control, this is correct and I believe I am a good leader, however this can cause issues as you can’t be a leader in every aspect of your life, sometimes it may make working for others difficult.
<p>
The learning style test indicates that I am a visual learner which I tend to agree with. I am better able to understand and explain things when I can visualise them in my head. I learn best from diagrams, graphs and videos and have a good memory of what I have seen. I am easily distracted by other visual cues around me when I am trying to study or concentrate and I study best using different colours when highlighting and using symbols to help understand and remember concepts. When I am planning events, I can visualise what things will look like and how they will run, I can create job lists in my head and tick them off as they get done. 
<p>
In the Big Five Personality test I scored very high for extraversion, this aligns with my personality correctly I am an incredibly social person who engages others for company, motivation and stimulation regularly. I also scored relatively high in conscientiousness, this means I am highly disciplined, organised and determined, these are all characteristics I possess, I have especially high organisational skills. I scored an average score for agreeableness which is a person’s cooperative skills, I am a highly competitive person and tend to enjoy being a leader. However, I scored 68% so I am slightly more agreeable than not. I scored 54% in openness, I am not imaginative at all and am bad at telling stories however I am very adventurous and of average intelligence. I am also a very practical person which tends away from openness. I scored a very low score of 12.5% in neuroticism as I am not a negative person and very rarely feel emotions or fear, anxiety or sadness.
<p>
I am good at working in a team as I am an extrovert with good social skills, I am good at listening to and reading others and discussing the pros and cons of every scenario. I have good organisation skills and am good at managing workload and team members, this along with good social skills are the assets of a good leader. I have a natural will to lead within groups however if the group has multiple people with this personality type we may be caused to butt heads. I am good at delegating jobs and am open to others ideas however will stand up for what I believe in if it is for the benefit of the groups outcome. As I am a visual learner it is likely that I will use visual aids within the group such as lists or diagrams to help members understand what I am trying to achieve. I will need to account for all learning styles within the group and may need verbalise and physically show my methods as well.
<p>
Ideally, in the formation of a team, it is good to acknowledge and possess all personality types. However not all teams are formed with the perfect mix of people and often at the beginning of communications members roles become clear without labelling. Often some individuals lead and organise, and others follow, have good ideas and do the technical skill heavy jobs automatically. In the formation of a team it is important to be aware of different personality types to get people to do jobs that best meet their skill set. If there is a team with multiple leaders, such as me, involved it is important to listen to what the team wants as a whole and do what is in the best interests of the team, this may mean a vote is needed to see who leads and who takes on other equally important and skilful roles. I am able to work hard in any role I have and am a loyal team member, my social skills mean that I will have good communication skills to help make the team successful.

<h3>Project Idea</h3>

<h4>Overview</h4>
I will be creating an interactive financial planning and budgeting app that a financial advisor is able to use as a resource to help service their clients. The app will provide client and adviser created budgets to meet the client’s financial goals and objectives in the short and long term to suit their financial plan. The app will include a section where clients can ask the adviser questions and the question will be emailed directly to the adviser. There will be a section in the app where the adviser can keep the client’s superannuation balance updated and personal insurance premiums and renewals can be maintained.

Motivation
In the 2019 Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry it was found that many advisors are charging fees for no or inadequate service. This app will provide an additional resource to provide clients with a service as well as be more readily available for clients to access their adviser and their goals, objectives and current financial standing any time of the day or night. There is insufficient technology in the market that allows for short and long term personal financial goals to align with day to day budgeting. I think this capability along with up to date superannuation valuations and current personal insurance premiums and sum insureds all in one place will allow for more successful financial plans. 

Description
The app will have six tabs that the client will be able to use to take them to different screen, including:
1)	 The first screen that will open when you go into the app will be the short-term goals section. Short-term goals are anything from monthly goals up till 5-year goals. You will be able to add this goal in whenever you like and work towards it, for example “save $10,000 by the end of the year to reroof the house”. All short-term goals need to consider long term financial goals, if a short-term goal may affect a long-term goal a notification will pop up and let you know that your long erm goal may need to be extended. This section will connect directly to your budget and will be automatically updated when you save or spend money to see how you are tracking on your short-term goals.
2)	Long term goals will be located in another tab within the app, this will include all goals greater than five years and will mostly be decided at client/adviser meetings. A long-term goal may be to “pay off the house debt in 10 years’ time”, this will be an adviser identified goals and may be put into the app at the time the advice is provided to the client. Prior to client and adviser reviews the adviser may check on this section of the app to see how their client is tracking with their goals and be better prepared for the client meeting.
3)	The budgeting tab will have bank connection functionality so that every transaction through the client’s bank account can be automatically categorised and recorded in the app. For example, if the client spends $90 at Coles it will automatically be recorded against the monthly groceries budget which may be $400. All budgets will link up with goals to make sure that spending’s and savings match and goals are achievable.
4)	The superannuation tab will be linked to the client’s superannuation account and will be updated at the close of markets each day to be the current super balance. When a client has a contribution go in, either a direct debit or employer superannuation they will get a notification. There will also be a tab to show how much has been contributed so far this financial year so they are able to track how much has been contributed and how much more they are allowed to contribute within the year. This section will also link to long term goals, for example if a goal is to “retire with $1,000,000 at age 67” the goal will be updated as to how much money is in both Superannuation and other savings accounts.
5)	The personal insurances tab will be updated each year to show indexed sums insured and new premiums, if premiums are paid monthly, how much of the annual premium that has been paid will also be shown.
6)	The final tab will be a questions tab where all questions asked by the client will be emailed directly to their linked financial advisor. The financial advisor can either reply in the app in real time or reply via email next time they are in office.
Clients will be able to select which sections of the app they are ok with their advisor seeing for privacy purposes.

Tools and Technologies
I will need to be able to write the appropriate code to make all the above-mentioned links work. I would also need to use an app maker of some sort. I would first trial the MIT app maker to see how the functionality turned out. MIT app maker is a free, step by step tool for beginners to make apps so it may not have the adequate capability to make the advance app I wish to make. I would also need an appropriate computer set up and designing capabilities to make the app user friendly.

Skills Required
To create this app I would need to be an advanced computer programmer and be competent in many coding languages. I would need to have appropriate app designing and layout skills as well as the adequate app designing and development software. With my limited coding and app development knowledge it is unlikely that I would be able to make this app without copious amounts of study or employing someone to create my idea and design. I know that this would help in the client adviser relationship however it is unlikely I would be able to develop this app on my own.

Outcome
If I am able to get this app off of the ground, I believe it would help dramatically in advisors’ ability to provide a better service to their clients. It is difficult for advisers to service all of their clients to a high level, this will help with day to day management of clients. Clients will be able to check how they are tracking in their personal financial goals whenever they like, this will make for better client outcomes. It will be difficult to achieve with my limited app development and coding skills however if I am able to get the adequate assistance I believe the app will be successful.
